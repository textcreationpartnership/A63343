            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Anniverſary Feſtival</hi> For the Year, 1688.</head>
            <p>ALthough the preſent Juncture of Affairs, and the Rumour of a Foreign Invaſion has Eclips'd the Glory of this Days Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; yet ſince the Mayoralty has fallen in the Firſt of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and in the time of ſo Eminent a Patriot, I think my ſelf in duty bound, to Publiſh this ſhort Deſcription, that what it wants in the Pageantry, may be ſupplied by a Panegyrick, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the Occurrences of ſo remarkable a Jubilee. The Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful the Company of <hi>Mercers,</hi> (who have the Honour and Charge of this Day's Entertainment) are the firſt in Order and Place, having the Priority of all other Companies of <hi>London.</hi> They were Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed to be a Company, and to purchaſe Lands in the 17th Year of the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the II, 1393. <hi>Mercers Hall,</hi> famous for the Magnificence of its Structure, is the Seat of their Publick Aſſemblies; where are likewiſe ſeveral ſpacious Rooms and Apartments, for their private Courts, Committees, and Conſultations. This was formerly an Hoſpital, Founded by Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Acon; Militia Hoſpitalis,</hi> ſaith the Record of <hi>Edward</hi> the III, Founded by <hi>Thomas Fitz Theobald,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. It was purchaſed by the <hi>Mercers,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII, by the Famous Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham.</hi> The Chappel was Founded by that Eminent Patron and Benefactor, Sir <hi>John Allen,</hi> who lies there Intomb'd.</p>
            <p>This particular Record I thought neceſſary to make, that the want of a Shew might not Derrogate from the Grandeur of ſo Antient and Honourable a Society.</p>

Nevertheleſs, though the Pageantry was Omitted, there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could contribute to make it Great both by Land and Water; nay, rather more Sumptuous in the Magnificence of their Cavalcade, which was in the manner following.</p>
